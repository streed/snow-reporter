          <p>Change does not happen if data is bad. We hope to provide areas with the tools to record
            snow data accurately so that smart and informed decisions can be made about these outdoor
            areas.

          <p>As our environment changes through our inactions we can work on preserving what we have
            left. Through a combination of accurate data and resonsible data reports we can help
            provide a stronger voice towards slowing the effect of climate change.
